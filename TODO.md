- rename the repository from `WAYFIRE-IPC` to `WAYFIRE-I3-IPC`
- check where it's possible to call a distributed fuction with ipc instead of writing/maintaining my own duplicated code
- sync commands, criteria, etc with [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway)
- move to nlohmann_json (if possible)
- move to the workspace sets api (and call the ipc plugin for all actions)
- use the wf::scene api to generate the json tree (if possible)
- deprecate, then remove `wf-msg` (just get swaymsg directly from sway, or [dart_swaymsg](https://github.com/AR-CADE/dart_swaymsg))
