- Dispite the heavy change of the current wayfire main branch (that we can call wayfire 8 beta), this plugin still compile and work correctly ... and it's pretty cool. But i plan to update this plugin once wayfire 8 will be released as stable, make it more as an extention of the comming native ipc plugin and use some of the cool new features around the ipc, until that i will just try to make this plugin compatible with the waifire main branch.
